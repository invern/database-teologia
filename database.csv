Rather, it is a true «theological locus», i.e. the opportunity for a broader and more complete «theological gesture» that takes the complexity of life seriously, without renouncing to the possibility of giving it an evangelical and theological interpretation. A research just carried out in the French-speaking province of Canada (Quebec) offers the possibility to validate this intuition and to make a «lived theology», which then corresponds to the theological style that Pope Francis identifies as essential for the life of the Church today.",2025-03-01,2025-07-21 15:51:26,2025-10-13 08:23:38,2025-10-12 23:11:50,71-87,,1,50,,Teologia,Il credere cristiano alla prova della condizione urbana,,,,,,,ita,,,,185851668,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,"articolo recente, il pdf non è scaricabile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

La Chiesa non deve cedere alla rassegnazione, ma osare con coraggio l'annuncio del Vangelo. Questa spinta missionaria, radicata nella Tradizione, trova una precisa indicazione nel concilio Vaticano II, che auspica una Chiesa capace di penetrare e trasformare la società in cui vive. Tale necessità di una ""Chiesa in uscita"" è reinterpretata attraverso la metafora delle ""eterotopie"" urbane, spazi che legano storie di vita e tradizioni alla Tradizione (la memoria viva del Risorto), attivando processi di ordinazione simbolica. Il percorso intellettuale dell'articolo mira al rilancio dell'operazione sacramentale della Chiesa: sono necessarie persone, luoghi ed esperienze che diano nuovamente concretezza alla fede, incarnando l'esperienza cristiana nel quotidiano. Drawing upon his previous reflections on the subject, the author emphasizes how urban culture profoundly interrogates popular Catholicism and some of its distinctive features, such as the observance of Sunday Precept. The Church must not succumb to resignation but rather boldly dare to proclaim the Gospel. This missionary impetus, rooted in Tradition, finds a precise indication in the Second Vatican Council, which envisions a Church capable of penetrating and transforming the society in which it lives. This necessity for a Church which ""goes forth"" is reinterpreted through the metaphor of urban ""heterotopias"", spaces that connect life stories and traditions to Tradition (the living memory of the Risen Christ), activating processes of symbolic ordering. The intellectual trajectory of the article aims at the revitalization of the Church's sacramental operation: people, places, and experiences are needed to give concreteness to faith anew, embodying the Christian experience in everyday life.",2025-03-01,2025-07-21 15:51:30,2025-10-13 08:23:21,2025-10-12 23:11:50,89-103,,1,50,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,185851669,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,"articolo recente, il pdf non è scaricabile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From a methodological standpoint, the thesis is that rather than the relationship between ""Christians and the city"" one should speak of ""Christians in the city"". It follows that it is important to consider not so much the relationship between two abstract entities (Christianity/Church and the city), but rather the actual occurrence of the experience of faith on the part of citizen-Christians. At the level of content, this perspective involves confronting urban culture with the aim of recognising the forms that the overall figure of an urban Christianity takes and the conditions of the emergence of a city-sized Church.

Starting from a critical analysis of the Urban Theology Group's approach and comparing it with the magisterial production (in particular, the Second Vatican Council and the Popes Paul VI and Francis), the author highlights four methodological thresholds to be crossed in order to adequately investigate the relationship between the Church (Christianity) and the city: 1) assuming the real city; 2) integrating the contribution of human sciences and theology; 3) overcoming the antagonistic vision between the city and the Church (Christianity); 4) recognizing the active role of Christians in the transformation of urban culture.

Drawing on Meir Sternberg's narrative theory and contemporary liturgical hermeneutics, the study argues that the liturgy does not merely read Scripture but re-presents it as a living, present, and performative word. The essay offers a theoretical reflection on the phenomenon of quotation and illustrates its liturgical implications through a case study: the first reading of the Christmas Midnight Mass (Isaiah 9:1-6). The analysis highlights the dynamic tension between source and frame, between original meaning and liturgical interpretation, providing tools for a deeper understanding of the Word of God in the act of celebration.",2025-06-01,2025-11-05 14:35:14,2025-11-18 10:46:24,2025-11-05 14:35:14,183-202,,2,50,,Teologia,Parola di Dio - Parola del Signore,,,,,,,ita,,,,188511371,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,"articolo recente, il pdf non è scaricabile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dei Verbum 8), and that the community of theologians - an essential component in the development and understanding of doctrine - is made up of people from different eras and contexts. But it is also true that individual generations of theologians have often been unable or unwilling to adequately consider this diachronicity of the intellectus fidei, and have ignored or underestimated significant segments and emblematic productions of the era: the poor knowledge of 18th-century Catholic theology - which, according to some, is merely a sum of ""isms"" (Augustinianism, Jansenism, Enlightenment, Jurisdictionalism"") - is clear evidence of this. This deficiency can only be overcome through the patient recovery of faces, human events and writings: the essay offered here - derived from a more extensive and detailed work dedicated to Giuseppe Bertieri, an Augustinian theologian who taught at the Theological Faculty of Vienna from 1768 to 1789 - shows the relevance and value of this research.",2025-06-01,2025-11-05 14:35:14,2025-11-18 10:46:01,2025-11-05 14:35:14,271-302,,2,50,,Teologia,Giuseppe Bertieri (1734-1804),,,,,,,ita,,,,188511375,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,"articolo recente, il pdf non è scaricabile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A close reading of the text permits to explore Cain's dysfunctional relational context. Actually, Cain's relationship with his parents is barely sketched as problematic and marked by the absence of the paternal authority. On the other hand, Cain's relationship with his brother does not exist at all, despite their common biological origin, and quickly gives way to homicidal rivalry. In this story, since God does not only play an ethical and sanctioning role, but first of all is another-in-dialogue and a father, his relationship with Cain establishes the individual's dignity that is permanently recalled, even when it seems to be lost. In his entire involvement (from lack of consideration to spoken words) the divine character, in fact, tries to give Cain his own suum by recognizing Cain's dignity, autonomy, freedom, right to exist, so that, once out of his relational inability, Cain may be capable of assimilating the rules that promote coexistence, with a renewed dignity.",2024,2024-10-16 22:29:53,2025-10-14 11:58:56,,35-55,,1,49,,,,,,,,,,it,,,,,Zotero,,,,"articolo recente, il pdf non è scaricabile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Referring mainly to the dialogues and theological debate that developed in the USA and in Germany, the article aims at highlighting the hermeneutical criteria applied by Catholic and Protestant theology to interpret the Tridentine teaching on Eucharist. In the first part, some general considerations are proposed on the meaning of the confession of faith and dogma in relation to the historical situation in which they arise, to the theological concepts they use and to the link with the tradition of faith considered in its full historical extent. In the second part, attention is directed more specifically to hermeneutics applied to the idea of the Eucharist as sacrifice and to the doctrine of transubstantiation.",2021-06-01,2025-10-14 16:12:46,2025-10-14 16:15:37,2025-10-14 16:12:45,179-218,,2,46,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,151810554,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,"articolo recente, il pdf non è scaricabile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present article is an attempt to emphasize that a satisfactory reply cannot be found by denying the difficulties and upholding unbending attitudes; what is needed is an overall reflection on the identity and on the mission of the Church in today's world. With this firmly in mind, the author has selected two pastoral methods which he proceeds to examine thoroughly in order to clarify their implications on theology and ecclesiology. In the final section of his investigation he has given space to criteria which can gainfully be considered for use in youth groups. The first model chosen - known as pastorale d'engendrement - considers the need for the Church to rethink as regards a social context (Belgian and French) which is facing progressive disintegration. The second model - known as pastorale urbana - has a Latin-American matrix (Aparecida) and is based on the concept of the ""mission"".

Particular attention is given to the connection between the objective and the subjective. With this aim in sight we first examined the criticism regarding the subjective understanding of the Exhortation. This was raised by four cardinals who duly signalled the points requiring clarification from the Holy Father, and here a reading of the Thomist interpretation is given which links the object (act) to the subject (intention). In order to overcome the alternative between the objectivity of the precept and the subjectivity of the conscience, this article proposes a theoretical review of the connection between conscience and precept. Rather than interpret these as in direct confrontation, they have been considered from the point of view of the link existing between the conscience and the act. This comment ends by underlining the manner - non-applicable but not for this reason to be underrated as merely relativistic - of the process of discernment, understood as being an act of the conscience which, when faced with a concrete situation, responds to the appeal of God in the particular relationship.",2018-03-01,2025-11-06 17:58:18,2025-11-06 18:22:18,2025-11-06 17:58:18,18-47,,1,43,,Teologia,Coscienza e discernimento,,,,,,,ita,,,,128913364,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZlPc0NL9V25YPnW8Dn5-eM52JMe6FhxL/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Przywara in 1955, and has been claimed since the 1920s, when he wrote his apologia to justify himself from the criticism that came from the theological world (in particular K. Barth and H. U. von Balthasar). According to Przywara, they hadn't understood his concept of analogia entis, as he really had sustained from the start of his research The purpose of this article is to once again give voice to Przywara, in order to discover the real intentions that have always led his work. We will find a new way to understand the concept of analogy, that cannot just be deciphered from the metaphysical point of view. For this hermeneutic we need the biblical notion of the relationship between God and his creature, both included as personal instances. This new matrix will change the classical interpretation of the epistemology of Przywara and will transform the way of understanding the three fundamentals axes of his thought: the conception of creation, the definition of negative theology and the comprehension of christology.",2018-06-01,2025-11-06 18:00:37,2025-11-06 18:23:57,2025-11-06 18:00:37,183-209,,2,43,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,130763932,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W6gkw-eAOqU1DGcTxdfep4HO-opuV_Hp/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, what is indifference? The thesis underlying this article is that this heart affection is not a univocal reality There are two indifferences, which are very different from each other both for the contents (what is bracketed) and for the form (the modality of bracketing). And if the former (closing indifference) characterizes the present-day super-man's lifestyle, the latter (opening indifference) belongs to God and the Holy. This dual form of indifference is here explained within Pascal's works, taking as a starting-point the enigmatic reference to the two turns of imagination in the Fragment 531L. The study of the dual indifference will finally allow us to outline three guiding principles for the path of new evangelization: to do otherwise, rather than doing more; to leave worldliness; to reform, rather than reorganizing.",2018-06-01,2025-11-06 18:00:37,2025-11-06 18:07:52,2025-11-06 18:00:37,236-261,,2,43,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,130763934,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z67thoJhbaYTxa4WNvrTigtHOW7k2jjN/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two aspects, seemingly diverse, actually converge on the current question of theology, because, since phenomenology claims to put itself today as the hair metaphysics, theology was constituted in the Middle Ages by the meeting-contamination between metaphysics and faith. From a hermeneutics of medieval theology pointing out the different models of the relationship between faith and reason and between philosophy and theology there emerges that the integration of metaphysics with phenomenology is not enough to execute the aim of the encyclical; it is necessary that theology should produce its own model and it cannot unless passing through biblical hermeneutics.",2018-06-01,2025-11-06 18:00:37,2025-11-06 18:09:00,2025-11-06 18:00:37,171-182,,2,43,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,130763931,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YSUD2_NiQHZ1Y4dtwz0n1c0jCBqCcejM/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following the invitation, this article focuses on the doctrinal core of the document which states the inseparable connection between the unitive significance and the procreative significance of the marriage act, i.e. between the deep union of the couple and their aptitude for generating new life. Considering that the procreative significance usually plays a privileged role, this article restores the proper value of the unitive significance, hence shedding light on how the integrity of personal love suffers not only when the sexual intercourse includes contraception, but also when it does not occur. Consequently, the article examines the thorny question of the possible conflict between the two significances in actual married life and offers criteria for the discernment of conscience which the couple are invited to use in order to incarnate the fruitful communion of love.",2018-10-01,2025-11-06 18:03:59,2025-11-06 18:24:14,2025-11-06 18:03:59,442-471,,3,43,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,133218285,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qL5XFqxCAmoa-JvUQa8u0CrBhQ6E5KzZ/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks to some narrative tools, this study focuses on the presence of God both by exploring how it is narrated and by elucidating the keys to discern it. Ruled by an inverse proportion in Genesis, the dialectic between God's presence and human responsibility is more nuanced in the book of Exodus and the narrative is on a double level: the reader is associated to Moses' full comprehension, while the characters have the burden of the discernment. Exodus narrative makes both the divine and the human point of view simultaneously present, joining divine presence and divine invisibility, visibility and listening skills, interweaving God's interventions with human freedom and responsibility and indicating to the reader that the reception of Moses and his mediation through the written text leads him to read and recognize the presence of God as in the splendor and in the signs of his power, as in the eloquent concealment of the word.

The first one is the appointment of seven men entrusted with the ministry of distributing food to the widows of the Church of Jerusalem (Acts 6). The second one is the resolution of the dissent which emerged in three Christian communities against the Apostle Paul's decision to go to Jerusalem (Acts 20-21). In both problematic situations the style of true ecclesial discernment allowed the Holy Spirit to accomplish everything for the good of those who loved God (cfr.

Ricoeur showed that temporality is built by discourse; each literary genre thus produces its own temporality through its specific form. As a result, Ricoeur argued, there is not a ""biblical time"" but there are different ""times"" in the Bible. Biblical historiography, which is basically narrative, regularly associates other genres with the narrative. 1-2 Samuel, for example, also contains oracles and poems. The purpose of this article is to study the connection between the literary form of each genre and the kind of temporality it produces.

The historical-critical method is necessary in order to go back, as far as possible, to the circumstances that caused the writing of the Pauline text. It nevertheless does not clarify neither the strategies he adopts to intervene in that situation, nor the theological convictions he realizes. So, it becomes necessary a literary-rhetorical analysis of the text. This one results dependent from the propositio of 1:17, that declares the importance of the Cross in the Christian preaching (theme developed in 1:18-2:5) and Paul's role as envoy from Christ the Lord (theme developed in 3:5-17). In this way, Paul starts from a general subject (quaestio infinita) in order to clarify a contingent matter, i.e. the correct appraisal of missionaries and their work (quaestio finita). In 2:6-16 there is a digressio, that clarifies the work of the Spirit in revealing God's project that overturns human criteria, followed by a severe consequence for the audience in 3:1-4. Thereby the Biblical Text consists of an upstream reference, i.e. the Christological event object of the Christian preaching, and of a downstream reference, i e. the audience urged to reconfigure their values on this basis. Through the survey of the literary articulation of the text, exegesis must highlight these references.

From this point of view his Magisterium fails to stimulate theology - and moral theology in particular - in a positive manner. This diffidence however seems to have its roots in an outdated form of theology, as represented in particular by the casuistic tradition warmly upheld by recent Church teaching.

In the eyes of the modern scholar, the process of allegorization is felt to be arbitrary and indeed a violence practised on the text, only to be justified by the satisfactory pastoral conclusion. These pages aim at establishing a solid foundation for a more serene study of the exegesis which has come down to us from these early Christian authors. They specify which methodological elements cannot be overlooked, but at the same time they eliminate that reticence which even today tends to condition our approach to this kind of literature. Here it must be underlined that the study of biblical exegesis originating in the early centuries of Christianity does not aim at proving its actuality or scientific reliability, nor does it intend to represent those hermeneutical theories for today's world, but rather to gather together, in an objective manner, the significance and the riches of the texts.",2017-06-01,2025-11-05 20:06:35,2025-11-05 20:45:50,2025-11-05 20:06:34,232-254,,2,42,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,123748402,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O6PFHJpGJIwHITM1G8DDS-tSuoqd_9Dv/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying question, of course, touches on the uniqueness and the universal nature of the Revelation, the absolute truth it contains, and therefore the reality of faith. The criticism levelled at Simone Weil by E. Lévinas offers an opportunity to consider the philosopher's point of view. Lévinas puts forward the suggestion that we are in the presence of a two-way conditioning, between that of the subject and that of God, but he fails to carry out this proposal due to an approach which upholds and maintains the form of indeterminate otherness for transcendence. The perspective offered by Simone Weil appears more comprehensive and radically christological, as it underlines the fact that man cannot pertain to a state of transcendence as his original condition and without this totality there is no real act. Weil's thought represents an original contribution towards overcoming mutual opposition between the two paradigms and directs us towards a Christologically-oriented ""philosophical theology"" able to justify the relevance of the philosophical element of faith.",2017-06-01,2025-11-05 20:06:35,2025-11-06 17:52:57,2025-11-05 20:06:35,255-285,,2,42,,Teologia,"Una ""rivelazione"" greca?",,,,,,,ita,,,,123748403,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/19GznF6RbU0ynl2XqNZGvhloueUTHNmaO/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is evident that we are living in a new age in which images are more and more important in our culture and in our life. We are now living in a world in which the mode of transmission of the canon, i.e. the conveyance of our heritage is modified by the superiority that the image paradigm has acquired in relation to the traditional paradigm of verbal logos. The question is of primary importance both from a historical and a theoretical point of view. The result is such a profound modification of the form and of the media of transmission of cultural traditions that it implies a totally new consideration of our relationship with the past and our heritage. We can say something else and something more: it is now through images that we are becoming conscious of ourselves in all the areas of culture, from science to art.

From here the author goes on to examine the stand Pope Francis takes on ecclesiology, with a view to a revision of the Church's teaching on moral theology. This contribution develops three principal points: the Pope's view of ecclesiology; his theological roots, and from here those ideas which can be applied to today's teaching of moral theology. This should mirror the outlook of Vat. II, reinterpreting it in the light of the Latin-American experience. The proposal which emerges is for a grassroots theology: dialogue ad intra with the differing levels of the faithful, and ad extra with the various branches of scientific thought and with the other religions. Moral theology today needs to be revamped with an eye to the evangelization of the modern world; we need to promote a culture of communication which is born in the mystical dimension.

On itself, the human force, is incapable of raising itself to the knowledge of the Uncreated Being. The way to perfection is, in fact, a self-reaching out (epéktasis) towards God, without ever pretending to have achieved it. The theme is treated both in the Commentary on the Song of Songs and in the work The life of Moses, where the author retakes the allegorico-spiritual salient phases of Moses' ascensions to Mount Sinai. There, the great lawgiver meets the Lord, or better, perceives the presence in a mysterious way. In this perspective, growth in virtue allows man to purify himself and to elevate himself to an increasingly intense participation in divine life.

Since his youth, Martin, already a sensitive personality, had many chances to widen his perception of the spiritual dimension of life: he briefly attended a school run by the Brothers of The Common Life; he had some strong spiritual experiences; under the direction of Johann Staupitz, he extensively read the works of Meister Eckhart, Johann Tauler, Heinrich Seuse. Later on he happened to found a little book by an anonymous author, which contained what to him looked like «a pure, solid theology, most similar to the ancient one».

In this way, the cross of Christ is read as the exclusive soteriological event: the redemption of humanity is realised when God seems to be paradigmatically absent (""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"").

On the other hand it is their emblematic feature and their strategic role in front of a ""spirituality"" of thinking, which interfaces themes of incredible actuality: the form of reaching truth by human conscience, the ontological supremacy of justice, the sensitive quality of a spirit, the spiritual structure of a subject, the principle of God nomination as an ethic of a tie to Him.

The term ""sinodality"" has come back, and it is used to mean that all faithful are involved in making decisions which should direct the life of the Church. The present essay aims to, first, show the meaning that ""sinodality"" acquires in Pope Francis's addresses. Then, the essay looks for the roots of the term in recent theological reflection; limitations thereof are also pointed out, especially the one which does not take into sufficient account the fact that the Church is a historic entity, it is placed in history, and fails to notice that synods depend on the historic and cultural components of the time. Finally, the essay shows that synodic processes, which are always predicated upon the Eucharistic and Trinitarian roots of the Church, achieve and apply shared responsibility, to which all faithful are called by God. The point the essay means to make is that, as an abstract term, ""sinodality"" is not a res; some decision-taking processes follow different procedures, which, however, have to reflect all the faithful shared responsibility in the mission the Church. What really counts is shared responsibility, and synods are just a way to fulfill it.",2016-06-01,2025-11-05 14:38:49,2025-11-05 14:51:21,2025-11-05 14:38:49,249-273,,2,41,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,118126403,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OECcFX94yiFNkH-xNLpD6sfQhh4cmVaD/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first sequence: the event itself, a witness that gives his testimony and the “attesting text” written by the witness itself (or by his disciples). The second sequence: the attestation of the written testimony (it has to be read with critical method), the crossing through the experience of the witness, to reach the goal – at the end, possibly – that is to relive the original event. The wider horizon of the inspiration concept establishes a fruitful relationship with the theme of the Holy Scriptures Canon and becomes the source from which to draw the identity of the people who recognizes its own “founding memory”, that is the symbolic pact that binds the past to allow to the new generation to relive and bring forward what has been delivered by the earlier tradition and the interpreter recognizes the Scriptures as God’s Word. In the third paragraph, the incarnation model is used to better define the singularity of the inspired Word.

Pannenberg can be the opportunity to try a first evaluation of his extraordinary intellectual adventure which dominated theology in Germany in the second half of the twentieth century. He was a leading figure of that third generation of those Evangelical theologians who were not content with the over-historicity of Revelation, of existential historicity, but who tried to explore God’s reality in itself. Therefore history is for Pannenberg not only the place where God reveals himself but also the one of his self realization as it is confirmed by Christology, anthropology and epistemology as well. Considering faith while communicating with reality which determines everything was a decisive step to focus on that universal tangible concept which draws pure intellect out of theoretical emptiness and creates from its free and personal singularity the eternal relationship between a person and God’s freedom through Christology. A logical axis becomes a historical-eschatological one, its examination is bound to a future which gives back to Trinitarian theology the primary function of the event of mutual even if asymmetric communication to a human being, to any human being.",2015-03-01,2025-10-26 11:16:29,2025-10-26 11:22:12,2025-10-26 11:16:29,63-83,,1,40,,Teologia,Wolfhart Pannenberg,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178598,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NBYZgPxKpDBogSgTOyK5r84Fcxx98AXc/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this short essay, surely not denying this reality, we try to insert the path which precedes and follows the First Vatican Council inside the secular cycle of modernity from its origin to its present decline which leads the Church from the Council of Trent to the Second Vatican Council.

In order to find an answer to this question, the author analyzes 63 texts from the council which contain the word historia or the related adjective (historicus). Beside a massive recurrence of this term – an innovation if compared with all the previous councils – the Vatican II reveals a double interest towards past history and present history as well. Above all, in the perspective set out by the council, the Church itself has a strong historical dimension. As a consequence, there is a rise in concern about ecclesiastical historiography, which at the same time gets more conscious of worldwide and ecumenical issues and more receptive to the various expressions of the life of Christian communities.",2015-03-01,2025-10-26 11:16:29,2025-10-26 11:28:45,2025-10-26 11:16:29,29-62,,1,40,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178583,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hXqyNPdeVHoB-2k3kdBPKCEhWlDArkgm/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the canonical discipline, in order for a marriage to be valid there is no need for a certain level of faith, but only true consent is required. It is also claimed that the canonical form is needed just for disciplinary reasons while the liturgical form is accounted only as a solemnitas externa of the sacrament. The paper analyzes the causes of such issues, linking them to the modern anthropology of the subject, which has had a deeper influence on the theology of marriage than the biblical anthropology of the foedus. The Author offers some overall rethinking on the matter and comes to two main conclusions. (1) The liturgical form is to be intended as constitutive of the sacrament of marriage, and not just as a ritual ornament of the consent. It is not a supplement to the matrimonial consent, but it is key to shape it. (2) The availability to accept the religious dimension, i.e. “being united by God”, as well as the willingness to be included in the one faith of the Church are the two requirements for a true consent to make the sacramental marriage.",2015-06-01,2025-10-26 11:18:44,2025-10-26 12:34:53,2025-10-26 11:18:44,212-249,,2,40,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120175369,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ccYUCLSn3b1ks6cl55qtg23Fietko1WD/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stake is very challenging: by the renewal of the themes concerning human sexuality, the relationship among men, women and procreation and the sacrament of matrimony, Gaudium et spes is at the same time the arrival point of a long tradition and a starting one to go on thinking. It is nowadays the task of moral theology to take up the council teachings about matrimony and family to gather their instances, to underline their critical knots, to thematize their doubts and to suggest an interpretation of all that could be equal to Christian witness.

The early model of the constitution of a synod can be found in the Acts of the Apostles 15. Thanks to John XXIII and Paul VI the idea of a Synod was revitalized. Pope Montini, in particular, established the Synod of the Bishops, in the development of which – while consulting the whole of God’s people – Pope Francis showed he wanted “a listening magistery”.

Following the impulse imprinted by Pope Francis in Catholicism there took place a resetting of convictions and persuasions which were not immediately coincident and even conflicting between each other in the background of the never subsided tension between “doctrine” and “pastoral practice”. On the other side the transforming collective mentality in the matter of family and procreation sounds like objective provocation. Considering the dimension and the impact of the movements in progress believers must duly wonder about the adequacy of the impressed lay-out of Catholic debate.

The most original and promising particular of the review worked out by Taylor consists of the choice of interpreting such a plot not only starting from the passing of theoretic models but also starting from the changes of socio-cultural and ecclesiastical practice. The ground thesis is that the aforesaid changes do not necessarily state, at all, the end of religious and particularly Christian experience but on the contrary they prepare the conditions for an unsuspected re-pattern of its. Therefore in our present age the concept of secularization may send, from one side, to the reduction of the link to God to a completely optional addition to the practice of a good life; but from the other side it may positively remark the character of a free and responsible reply implied by a believing act, being thoughtfully conscious that it is always practicable to get back to exclusive humanism.",2015-09-01,2025-10-26 11:19:40,2025-10-26 12:37:58,2025-10-26 11:19:40,432-450,,3,40,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120175335,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HgYJH_xPFQIH_r9w5F33QHDe9Bz0jul0/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A correct Christ-centred definition of theology actually sends back to the mission of the Son who is Jesus in his singular historical authenticity, the same to the mission of the Holy Spirit who is the highest truth of the Grace in us. We understand how the principle and the total object of theology is really the Trinitarian mystery, that is the gift of himself that God performs from the beginning of Creation, predestinating us in Christ to the communion with Him. The original and radical unity of Christ’s predestination is given us in Jesus’ singular story like a historical event, not-deducible and free, which preserves the original correlation of the involved terms (like the human and the divine, the natural and the supernatural, history and truth) without obliged reductions or deductions.

After rhapsodic expounding the contemporary spiritual background the article concentrates on the analysis of two suggestions of “atheistic spirituality” (A. Comte- Sponville and L. Ferry). Their essential elements, their interests and their incongruity are here pointed out. Above all here is stressed the supposed incompatibility of an authentically human discourse and a religious experience. In the last part of the essay some research tracks are analyzed which are rooted in some key texts of Council Vatican II, where the suggestion is to deepen the link between anthropological basic experience (freedom, desire, affections and fertility) and spiritual experience, rediscovering the anthropological and baptismal pertinence of the form of sequela Christi sine glossa (obedience, poverty, virginity).

They are indeed the core of the author’s ample and appreciated theological dissertation, whose fundamental principles they constitute. Ecumenism, at first seen as a dutiful, unavoidable task of Christian Creeds, minutely and reverentially stated in all the modes of its being put into effect, up to the tragically present one of martyrdom, which enumerate the victims of several religious confessions. At the core of such barbarian cruelty, there stands the contempt for the worth of man’s life and its basic existential meaning. This accounts for the choice of the second theme: the Eastern and Western common tradition concerning the concept of human being, traced back to the basis of an existential ecumenism capable of making unity compatible with the fundamental needs of mankind. The core of such a concept is to be found in the biblical assertion according to which the human being is God’s image in that the Trinitarian God of the Christians exists as a real human being. Trinitarian Theology, in such a way, acquires the highest anthropological meaning and asserts that our personal identity, as is the case for the personal divine identities, achieves its fullness not distancing the others, but in communion with them in and through ‘a’ love that is not confined to the self (1Cor 13.5); on the contrary it is open to sacrifice its very existence to allow the other to exist and to be ‘other’. The more and more urgent task of both Orthodox and Catholic Theologies, which have their roots in the common Patristic inheritance, is the strife to integrate Trinitarian, Christological and Anthropological Theologies thus to ‘serve’ the unity of the Church, not for itself but ‘so that the world may believe’ (John 17,21).",2015-12-01,2025-10-26 11:21:15,2025-10-26 12:42:45,2025-10-26 11:21:15,549-556,,4,40,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120176121,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/13e4siwDd09OU38c639rfUnAXb6S3Gz4-/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through this form the Church magistery means to propose prescriptive references able to stem the tendencies to moral relativism of a relevant part of contemporary culture. Still the resort to this formula, especially in public debates about the law solutions of “ethically sensible” questions, requires that a correct interpretation has to be given. For that reason it is useful to resume some categories and themes typical also of traditional Catholic moral doctrine. More precisely: the concept of intrinsice malum, the doctrine about unjust law, the criteria for the morality of cooperating to evil, the principle of obliquity, the distinction between public order and common good, the different theological trends of Thomist and Augustinian law. More generally it is necessary, anyway, to avoid to overestimate the resort to legislative intervention as a remedy to the drift of moral relativism, as far as such a drift is due to “structural” factors (for example of technical and economic nature) in comparison with “superstructural” factors (juridical ones in particular).",2014-06-01,2025-07-21 15:42:38,2025-10-25 21:59:58,2025-10-25 21:55:08,175-197,,2,39,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178985,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GXn68TXwK4eTLnq4IEASj-Yu3e2s6-pe/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These processes are effects of a deep-rooted individualism. What about the relationship between faith and social bond? The theology of gift elaborated by John Milbank is a viable and challenging answer for the Church in a post-secular society. Rooted in the Trinitarian mystery and developed through the Theo-ontological device of participation, Milbank’s conception of a “purified gift-exchange” (agape) is a Christian interpretation of Marcel Mauss’s work on the agonistic gift.

It appears that this language underlines the gratuitous character of God’s deed on our behalf, as it is shown in the Christ-event. Human beings, in this context Jews and Greeks alike, are urged to recognize this and to trust in Him in order to benefit from His gratuitous work. On the contrary, the works of Law are always excluded when justification is at stake. This exclusion is not due to a supposed meritorious character of the requirements of the Law, neither to its ethnical implications, even though the reflection on justification was developed by Paul first to counter the requirements of Judeo-Christian missionaries to the Galatian communities. By means of this reflection, Paul aims instead to deny the possibility of the Law to grant us a true relationship with God, as this is achieved by the redeeming work of Christ. So, the quality of the language of justification is theological, that is used to clarify the peculiarities of God’s action. In order to detect how Paul depicts the condition of believers who receive the gift of justification, how he values the acts of believers, and how he motivates them to an ethical responsibility, we need to check other languages, those by which he expresses participation and union of believers to Christ. For this reason, the article considers some of these, that is Baptism, the idea of partaking of the Body of Christ, the indwelling of the Spirit and, finally, the adoptive sonship. The resulting portrait of the believer is of a human being called to be responsible for the gift received, asked to show his faith in the whole of his bodily existence and in concrete deeds, and to act as he really is, a son or daughter who shows his status living in obedience to God.",2014-09-01,2025-07-21 15:42:36,2025-10-25 22:08:31,2025-10-25 22:02:15,344-375,,3,39,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178368,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cj45vHmedftpIf5rkecl3r_Q1Ww3FOua/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis starts from the comparison with the theological-fundamental statement by H. Verweyen, of which it is positively appreciated the project of intrinsically connecting the notitia Dei, testified by Jesus event, with the ratio veritatis implied in a subject’s self-determination. The assumption developed in this comparison is that the maintenance of the transcendental interpretation of freedom absolute sense, as a philosophic model for faith legitimacy, represents an obstacle for the coherence of that project. In particular that interpretation prevents: (a) from fully justifying the Christological features of unconditioned freedom, like the image (Bild) of God’s truth which contradicts the self-constitution of its principle; (b) from resisting the narcissistic regression of self-affection, which is restored to its authentic formal reason only through the theological injunction (Aufforderung) of the love for our fellow creatures.",2014-09-01,2025-07-21 15:46:23,2025-10-25 22:06:22,2025-10-25 22:02:15,404-424,,3,39,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178459,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fZduxs_ag6MBw_yijch5eQOb0LswzhV0/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A larger room is devoted to post-Easter Christianity, which three different cases are examined of. One is the pre-Pauline text of 1Cor 15,3 two different cultural categories are combined, of which the Greek one (through the syntagma “to die for”) and the Jewish one (through the noun “sins”). The other one, probably a pre-Pauline one as well, is Fil 2,7 which twines two cultural categories, of which the Greek one (but coming out of mythology according to which a god can change his morfē, which Plato already criticized) and a Semitic one (according to which the condition of a human being in front of God or the gods is the one of doúlos).

Such requests were felt by John XXIII, as it is shown in his inaugural address at Second Vatican Council: Gaudet Mater Ecclesia.

A Christian humanism is, as we learn from the first two narrations of creation, closely connected to acknowledgement and the price (prezzare) for human contingency and human vulnerability. The Biblical concept of time aims in the seventh day as the meaning of time at the festive new creation of the world in which the tangibility of man is celebrated in a particular way. The authentic human body consists of memory, as a second skin as it were, of impacts, violations, relations and contingencies in which is to be found – as Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit shows in the chapters “Revealed Religion” and “the absolute Knowledge” – the essential site of divine transcendence and the meaning of history. Ultimately the whole Bible, which in the revelation of Saint John shows once more a summary and a conclusion, is a depiction of this second skin of man, in which he allows his body and history to be clothed in order to open his self to the world in a new way. In this being unclosed to the world through the tangibility of the singular and the contingent lies the great humanistic and Christian challenge of an era “after the end of history”, a topic taken up again in an impressive manner by Musil’s novel.",2013-06-01,2025-07-21 15:46:26,2025-10-13 20:12:18,2025-10-13 19:29:52,177-214,,2,38,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178697,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/18K1mI1WjEyEL90LP4Nh9apawIFN3JyIT/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By reading them, according to a genetic method, we come to the conclusion that, in spite of some openings, the Council never considers religions as a whole positively (except for Jewish religion, although even about this one we must pay attention to the used language: it generally talks about “people”), but rather the elements which are present in them. As for what concerns such elements it must be noticed that, even if they are respectfully considered, they are never regarded such as to be taken in their historical form, but through a process which implies purification and fulfilment as well. Religions are not equalized then: both in LG 16 and NAe 2 there is a grading. If then we would like to quibble and observe how positive opinions are softened by introducing particles (aliquando, haud raro) we would realize how great caution is inserted in Council documents. We must then state that Second Vatican Council, contrary to what some interpreters wanted to see, does not assert religions, as they are, might be ways to salvation; in case we can say that “some elements” are a means of grace. As for interreligious dialogue it does not get the attention which it will get in the following decades: It enters the wider dialogue with the “world”.

The reason for this lack of interest is probably the preference given to a liturgical approach to the sacraments and the suspicion toward a heavy use of scholastic language in the conciliar decrees. On the other hand, the dogmatic character of the Tridentine doctrine on Eucharist calls for an appropriate interpretation, which is able to distinguish between binding teaching and theological language of the time. To help this discernment, the article exposes the main questions discussed at Trent by theologians and bishops during the debate that lead to the formulation of canons and doctrine. Three main issues are considered: the communion under both kinds and the tension between Christ’s institution and the practice of the Church, the real presence of Christ and the need for ontological categories to preserve catholic faith, the Eucharist as sacrifice and its relationship with the sacrifice of the Cross.

The present article starts from the assumption that the metaphysical themes may build a synthetic privileged passage to consider such a teaching as a whole and tries to show how the diffused paradigm of “the metaphysics of a being” may result enriched by the acknowledgment of the theological and ethic difference as both starting points of the ontological difference, the pivot of such paradigm. The survey intends to testify – partially at least – the work carried out during the annual meeting of the professors and lecturers of the Faculty and the Institutes connected to it, a meeting which took place on the 14th and the 15th June 2011 at Gazzada (VA) and assigned to Philosophy Teachings. There is, therefore, introduced again what was presented in that circumstance by Prof. Sequeri’s report. The documentation of the thesis exposed in such a report means to emprove the critical renewal of a theoretic suggestion, not so a diffused and common one, pointing out, as well – particularly in its final parts –, some cues for a possible teaching spin-off.

In order to this it is necessary to overcome a relationship of extraneity between theology and philosophy, where for one reason the philosophic reflection may be deprived of any theological profile and for ano - ther reason theology may be excluded from a universal anthropological importance and therefore deprived of a truthmaking meaning.

In close dialogue with his sources (in particular the Christian neoplatonic Dionysius the Areopagite), the famous German Cardinal elaborates a peculiar model of theology, based upon both the idea of unkowability and ineffability of God, on the one hand, and the conjectural character of human knowledge, on the other hand. This leads to a different logic (compared with the Aristotelian one), built on the coincidentia oppositorum, and to a different idea of truth, which shall be received, more than conquered by human mind. One of the most remarkable results of Nicolas’ perspective is certainly the central role he tries to grant Christ and his story in his system. Nevertheless, the privileged role played by the neoplatonic and dionysian idea of One, and of a unique and simple truth, makes Nicolas underestimate the importance of alterity in the concept of God, in his relationship with man and the world, as in the genesis of human identity and knowledge.",2012-06-01,2025-07-21 15:34:20,2025-10-13 08:18:05,2025-10-12 22:43:20,198-239,,2,37,,Teologia,L’«unica e semplice verità»,,,,,,,ita,,,,120177566,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VjpL-gbDBwoNQbvS4MsKrr753_qxEQQX/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are going to use it here to inquire if the acceptance of the Augustinian doctrine of the Holy Grace may have contributed to the further attachment to the spiritual anthropological perspective, which is rarely conceived as the life of the Spirit. The works ascribed to Fausto, abbot from Hière, then bishop in Riez in Haute Provence, build a restrained corpus, pertinent on the survey, as they contain a de spiritu sancto, a de gratia and also, in the Gallicana homiletic collection, a in pentecosten homily about the gift of the Spirit in confirmatio.

6DE7GXKP,journalArticle,2012,"Angelini, Giuseppe",L' aggiornamento: suggestioni e problemi di una formula fortunata,Teologia,,1120-267X,,,"At the beginning of the Second Vatican Council, in particular in John XXIII’s aim, the urging practical reformation (preaching language, ecclesiastic discipline, pastoral forms in general) seemed not to touch its depositum fidei; the clear-cut distinction between truth forever and historical forms caused the success of the updating category. That separation progressively became as clear as abstract; truth is certainly beyond historical forms, nevertheless it cannot be determined but by them. The “anachronism” of pastoral ministry is not only the effect of deplorable inactivity, it is also and above all the consequence of unsolved theoretical problems, caused by modern cultural changings. The concrete story of the Council progressively underlines the delicate and even dangerous feature of the updating process; it threatens to legitimate the adjusting to the new culture. In particular Paul VI, in a 1965 address, already pointed out to that risk and he distinguished between a relevant and irrelevant sense of updating. His Distinction prepared the schematic confrontation between two Council hermeneutical trends by Benedict XVI. The difference between a deplorable adjusting and a necessary confrontation with the new culture may be made clear only on condition that we distinctively investigate two thought orders: a) the theoretic one about the necessary difference between culture and conscience which cannot remove their relationship; b) the historical practical one about the forms of contemporary culture and in particular about the growing distance which, in late modernity, appears between conscience and culture; it threatens to become a radical break.
