The reason for this lack of interest is probably the preference given to a liturgical approach to the sacraments and the suspicion toward a heavy use of scholastic language in the conciliar decrees. On the other hand, the dogmatic character of the Tridentine doctrine on Eucharist calls for an appropriate interpretation, which is able to distinguish between binding teaching and theological language of the time. To help this discernment, the article exposes the main questions discussed at Trent by theologians and bishops during the debate that lead to the formulation of canons and doctrine. Three main issues are considered: the communion under both kinds and the tension between Christ’s institution and the practice of the Church, the real presence of Christ and the need for ontological categories to preserve catholic faith, the Eucharist as sacrifice and its relationship with the sacrifice of the Cross.

The present article starts from the assumption that the metaphysical themes may build a synthetic privileged passage to consider such a teaching as a whole and tries to show how the diffused paradigm of “the metaphysics of a being” may result enriched by the acknowledgment of the theological and ethic difference as both starting points of the ontological difference, the pivot of such paradigm. The survey intends to testify – partially at least – the work carried out during the annual meeting of the professors and lecturers of the Faculty and the Institutes connected to it, a meeting which took place on the 14th and the 15th June 2011 at Gazzada (VA) and assigned to Philosophy Teachings. There is, therefore, introduced again what was presented in that circumstance by Prof. Sequeri’s report. The documentation of the thesis exposed in such a report means to emprove the critical renewal of a theoretic suggestion, not so a diffused and common one, pointing out, as well – particularly in its final parts –, some cues for a possible teaching spin-off.

In this sense, the name revealed to Moses at the burning bush is qualitatively different, not only because it is not a received name, but also because the narrative form of Ex. 3 paradoxically contains both revelation and concealment: even though Yhwh responds to Moses when he asks for the name, He remains a mystery; His name is not explained based on what has been, but it is open to the future and it can only be understood by exploring its declinations according to contingency.

A close reading of the text permits to explore Cain's dysfunctional relational context. Actually, Cain's relationship with his parents is barely sketched as problematic and marked by the absence of the paternal authority. On the other hand, Cain's relationship with his brother does not exist at all, despite their common biological origin, and quickly gives way to homicidal rivalry. In this story, since God does not only play an ethical and sanctioning role, but first of all is another-in-dialogue and a father, his relationship with Cain establishes the individual's dignity that is permanently recalled, even when it seems to be lost. In his entire involvement (from lack of consideration to spoken words) the divine character, in fact, tries to give Cain his own suum by recognizing Cain's dignity, autonomy, freedom, right to exist, so that, once out of his relational inability, Cain may be capable of assimilating the rules that promote coexistence, with a renewed dignity.",2024,2024-10-16 22:29:53,2025-10-14 11:58:56,,35-55,,1,49,,,,,,,,,,it,,,,,Zotero,,,,"articolo recente, il pdf non è scaricabile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks to some narrative tools, this study focuses on the presence of God both by exploring how it is narrated and by elucidating the keys to discern it. Ruled by an inverse proportion in Genesis, the dialectic between God's presence and human responsibility is more nuanced in the book of Exodus and the narrative is on a double level: the reader is associated to Moses' full comprehension, while the characters have the burden of the discernment. Exodus narrative makes both the divine and the human point of view simultaneously present, joining divine presence and divine invisibility, visibility and listening skills, interweaving God's interventions with human freedom and responsibility and indicating to the reader that the reception of Moses and his mediation through the written text leads him to read and recognize the presence of God as in the splendor and in the signs of his power, as in the eloquent concealment of the word.

A Christian humanism is, as we learn from the first two narrations of creation, closely connected to acknowledgement and the price (prezzare) for human contingency and human vulnerability. The Biblical concept of time aims in the seventh day as the meaning of time at the festive new creation of the world in which the tangibility of man is celebrated in a particular way. The authentic human body consists of memory, as a second skin as it were, of impacts, violations, relations and contingencies in which is to be found – as Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit shows in the chapters “Revealed Religion” and “the absolute Knowledge” – the essential site of divine transcendence and the meaning of history. Ultimately the whole Bible, which in the revelation of Saint John shows once more a summary and a conclusion, is a depiction of this second skin of man, in which he allows his body and history to be clothed in order to open his self to the world in a new way. In this being unclosed to the world through the tangibility of the singular and the contingent lies the great humanistic and Christian challenge of an era “after the end of history”, a topic taken up again in an impressive manner by Musil’s novel.",2013-06-01,2025-07-21 15:46:26,2025-10-13 20:12:18,2025-10-13 19:29:52,177-214,,2,38,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178697,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/18zzkQNzclzkJxflzXz_MfEzOTnDM6aKT/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By reading them, according to a genetic method, we come to the conclusion that, in spite of some openings, the Council never considers religions as a whole positively (except for Jewish religion, although even about this one we must pay attention to the used language: it generally talks about “people”), but rather the elements which are present in them. As for what concerns such elements it must be noticed that, even if they are respectfully considered, they are never regarded such as to be taken in their historical form, but through a process which implies purification and fulfilment as well. Religions are not equalized then: both in LG 16 and NAe 2 there is a grading. If then we would like to quibble and observe how positive opinions are softened by introducing particles (aliquando, haud raro) we would realize how great caution is inserted in Council documents. We must then state that Second Vatican Council, contrary to what some interpreters wanted to see, does not assert religions, as they are, might be ways to salvation; in case we can say that “some elements” are a means of grace. As for interreligious dialogue it does not get the attention which it will get in the following decades: It enters the wider dialogue with the “world”.

6DE7GXKP,journalArticle,2012,"Angelini, Giuseppe",L' aggiornamento: suggestioni e problemi di una formula fortunata,Teologia,,1120-267X,,,"At the beginning of the Second Vatican Council, in particular in John XXIII’s aim, the urging practical reformation (preaching language, ecclesiastic discipline, pastoral forms in general) seemed not to touch its depositum fidei; the clear-cut distinction between truth forever and historical forms caused the success of the updating category. That separation progressively became as clear as abstract; truth is certainly beyond historical forms, nevertheless it cannot be determined but by them. The “anachronism” of pastoral ministry is not only the effect of deplorable inactivity, it is also and above all the consequence of unsolved theoretical problems, caused by modern cultural changings. The concrete story of the Council progressively underlines the delicate and even dangerous feature of the updating process; it threatens to legitimate the adjusting to the new culture. In particular Paul VI, in a 1965 address, already pointed out to that risk and he distinguished between a relevant and irrelevant sense of updating. His Distinction prepared the schematic confrontation between two Council hermeneutical trends by Benedict XVI. The difference between a deplorable adjusting and a necessary confrontation with the new culture may be made clear only on condition that we distinctively investigate two thought orders: a) the theoretic one about the necessary difference between culture and conscience which cannot remove their relationship; b) the historical practical one about the forms of contemporary culture and in particular about the growing distance which, in late modernity, appears between conscience and culture; it threatens to become a radical break.

La Chiesa non deve cedere alla rassegnazione, ma osare con coraggio l'annuncio del Vangelo. Questa spinta missionaria, radicata nella Tradizione, trova una precisa indicazione nel concilio Vaticano II, che auspica una Chiesa capace di penetrare e trasformare la società in cui vive. Tale necessità di una ""Chiesa in uscita"" è reinterpretata attraverso la metafora delle ""eterotopie"" urbane, spazi che legano storie di vita e tradizioni alla Tradizione (la memoria viva del Risorto), attivando processi di ordinazione simbolica. Il percorso intellettuale dell'articolo mira al rilancio dell'operazione sacramentale della Chiesa: sono necessarie persone, luoghi ed esperienze che diano nuovamente concretezza alla fede, incarnando l'esperienza cristiana nel quotidiano. Drawing upon his previous reflections on the subject, the author emphasizes how urban culture profoundly interrogates popular Catholicism and some of its distinctive features, such as the observance of Sunday Precept. The Church must not succumb to resignation but rather boldly dare to proclaim the Gospel. This missionary impetus, rooted in Tradition, finds a precise indication in the Second Vatican Council, which envisions a Church capable of penetrating and transforming the society in which it lives. This necessity for a Church which ""goes forth"" is reinterpreted through the metaphor of urban ""heterotopias"", spaces that connect life stories and traditions to Tradition (the living memory of the Risen Christ), activating processes of symbolic ordering. The intellectual trajectory of the article aims at the revitalization of the Church's sacramental operation: people, places, and experiences are needed to give concreteness to faith anew, embodying the Christian experience in everyday life.",2025-03-01,2025-07-21 15:51:30,2025-10-13 08:23:21,2025-10-12 23:11:50,89-103,,1,50,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,185851669,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,"articolo recente, il pdf non è scaricabile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In close dialogue with his sources (in particular the Christian neoplatonic Dionysius the Areopagite), the famous German Cardinal elaborates a peculiar model of theology, based upon both the idea of unkowability and ineffability of God, on the one hand, and the conjectural character of human knowledge, on the other hand. This leads to a different logic (compared with the Aristotelian one), built on the coincidentia oppositorum, and to a different idea of truth, which shall be received, more than conquered by human mind. One of the most remarkable results of Nicolas’ perspective is certainly the central role he tries to grant Christ and his story in his system.

First of all, the possibility itself of historically dealing about an event still too near in time and about which a historical opinion still often tends to conform to the Church one; in the second place, whether and in what sense we may ascribe the value of a “historical turning point” to Second Vatican Council.",2013-03-01,2025-07-21 15:42:36,2025-10-13 08:16:35,2025-10-12 22:48:16,59-84,,1,38,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178498,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sSkx24zoiwzzFLh_ZoZ9bErUTqSr0ZS0/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prophecy is an essential element of the history of human salvation, as a way to pass on the “voice” of God, a transcendent one, who opposes the reality of a power which dominates the world, and which is disclosed in the Old Testament prophets and established by the mission committed by Christ to the Church. Moreover it has faded away through the coming of modernity and in some way it has broken up into two different sides of reality: from one part, by secularizing, it has become utopia and a revolutionary project as a vision of an ideal world, a “different” one in comparison with the existing one which must be fought and in any case transformed; to the other one prophecy has been substituted, inside the Church, by the “vision” which is still whispered in intimacy outside a historical context and which gets its validity either from the support of official Church or from holiness models worked out and approved by the Church itself.",2013-03-01,2025-07-21 15:42:36,2025-10-13 08:15:35,2025-10-12 22:48:16,6-25,,1,38,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178446,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ReBptsaF7HFf_eKl-WgX27J0Owq14e_f/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

True married love should reflect the love of Christ, as illustrated by Paolo in his famous Hymn in 1Cor 13. It is, in fact, the light emanating from the love of Christ which in turn enables conjugal love, compounding the three forms which love takes: eros: desire; philia: kindness and consideration; and agape: self-giving to one's spouse. The article first considers the distinctive aspects of these three components - erotic desire, kind friendship and self-giving love - and then reviews them in the light of their interaction and integration.

At the conclusion of the whole research, the questions raised by this theology's figure in saint Bonaventure shall be pointed out, but already the course of this first analysis puts some interrogatives on the consistency and possibility of this knowledge: these interrogatives are bound to be sharpened and put in form of real problems in correlation to the kind of culture and philosophy that the Seraphical Doctor afterwards submitted to a theoretical examination.",1978,2025-07-21 15:50:22,2025-10-26 16:43:07,,13-32,,1,3,,,,,,,,,,Italian,,,,,,,,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t4Nb_pg0Tw4NbTD1cU1BQNHkFa8eM8hB/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the confrontation between two representative models, the one (the Hobbesian one) of modernity, the other (the Tocquevillian one) of post-modernity, it appears clear as passions (that can be traced back to two fundamental cores of acquisitive passion and identifying one) are crucial either in their presence and their force, or in their absence or weakness. They give birth to those social and political pathologies which seem further on sharpened nowadays by globalization processes. It is nevertheless possible to think of a different passion array, removed from modernity, which can be defined as public and solidarity passions, that form the emotional fundament of acknowledgement and gift paradigms, and let us imagine a different idea of society and politics.",2014-03-01,2025-07-21 15:44:19,2025-10-25 21:52:57,2025-10-25 21:48:59,48-67,,1,39,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120177650,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UWNk9uzn7eFdxWZO1L3VHl0Xnh1nmYr7/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The eternal light of Truth, while shining over the whole creation, will meet its brightest reflection in the light of Mount Tabor. Its making a human being like God will give a man and the universe back to their original brightness, if there is found an adequate ascesis.

Through this form the Church magistery means to propose prescriptive references able to stem the tendencies to moral relativism of a relevant part of contemporary culture. Still the resort to this formula, especially in public debates about the law solutions of “ethically sensible” questions, requires that a correct interpretation has to be given. For that reason it is useful to resume some categories and themes typical also of traditional Catholic moral doctrine. More precisely: the concept of intrinsice malum, the doctrine about unjust law, the criteria for the morality of cooperating to evil, the principle of obliquity, the distinction between public order and common good, the different theological trends of Thomist and Augustinian law. More generally it is necessary, anyway, to avoid to overestimate the resort to legislative intervention as a remedy to the drift of moral relativism, as far as such a drift is due to “structural” factors (for example of technical and economic nature) in comparison with “superstructural” factors (juridical ones in particular).",2014-06-01,2025-07-21 15:42:38,2025-10-25 21:59:58,2025-10-25 21:55:08,175-197,,2,39,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178985,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YFM-mFY1vncLLVB3gFKwE-5y-4h7DphC/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A larger room is devoted to post-Easter Christianity, which three different cases are examined of. One is the pre-Pauline text of 1Cor 15,3 two different cultural categories are combined, of which the Greek one (through the syntagma “to die for”) and the Jewish one (through the noun “sins”). The other one, probably a pre-Pauline one as well, is Fil 2,7 which twines two cultural categories, of which the Greek one (but coming out of mythology according to which a god can change his morfē, which Plato already criticized) and a Semitic one (according to which the condition of a human being in front of God or the gods is the one of doúlos).

Verweyen, of which it is positively appreciated the project of intrinsically connecting the notitia Dei, testified by Jesus event, with the ratio veritatis implied in a subject’s self-determination. The assumption developed in this comparison is that the maintenance of the transcendental interpretation of freedom absolute sense, as a philosophic model for faith legitimacy, represents an obstacle for the coherence of that project. In particular that interpretation prevents: (a) from fully justifying the Christological features of unconditioned freedom, like the image (Bild) of God’s truth which contradicts the self-constitution of its principle; (b) from resisting the narcissistic regression of self-affection, which is restored to its authentic formal reason only through the theological injunction (Aufforderung) of the love for our fellow creatures.",2014-09-01,2025-07-21 15:46:23,2025-10-25 22:06:22,2025-10-25 22:02:15,404-424,,3,39,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178459,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cVXDhkeCXtyVlhYXV7IFG_H6otvGVlzp/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It appears that this language underlines the gratuitous character of God’s deed on our behalf, as it is shown in the Christ-event. Human beings, in this context Jews and Greeks alike, are urged to recognize this and to trust in Him in order to benefit from His gratuitous work. On the contrary, the works of Law are always excluded when justification is at stake. This exclusion is not due to a supposed meritorious character of the requirements of the Law, neither to its ethnical implications, even though the reflection on justification was developed by Paul first to counter the requirements of Judeo-Christian missionaries to the Galatian communities. By means of this reflection, Paul aims instead to deny the possibility of the Law to grant us a true relationship with God, as this is achieved by the redeeming work of Christ. So, the quality of the language of justification is theological, that is used to clarify the peculiarities of God’s action. In order to detect how Paul depicts the condition of believers who receive the gift of justification, how he values the acts of believers, and how he motivates them to an ethical responsibility, we need to check other languages, those by which he expresses participation and union of believers to Christ. For this reason, the article considers some of these, that is Baptism, the idea of partaking of the Body of Christ, the indwelling of the Spirit and, finally, the adoptive sonship. The resulting portrait of the believer is of a human being called to be responsible for the gift received, asked to show his faith in the whole of his bodily existence and in concrete deeds, and to act as he really is, a son or daughter who shows his status living in obedience to God.",2014-09-01,2025-07-21 15:42:36,2025-10-25 22:08:31,2025-10-25 22:02:15,344-375,,3,39,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178368,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F3-s1heHoZuHV0B87Sfjw980-p3IyyPG/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pannenberg can be the opportunity to try a first evaluation of his extraordinary intellectual adventure which dominated theology in Germany in the second half of the twentieth century. He was a leading figure of that third generation of those Evangelical theologians who were not content with the over-historicity of Revelation, of existential historicity, but who tried to explore God’s reality in itself. Therefore history is for Pannenberg not only the place where God reveals himself but also the one of his self realization as it is confirmed by Christology, anthropology and epistemology as well. Considering faith while communicating with reality which determines everything was a decisive step to focus on that universal tangible concept which draws pure intellect out of theoretical emptiness and creates from its free and personal singularity the eternal relationship between a person and God’s freedom through Christology. A logical axis becomes a historical-eschatological one, its examination is bound to a future which gives back to Trinitarian theology the primary function of the event of mutual even if asymmetric communication to a human being, to any human being.",2015-03-01,2025-10-26 11:16:29,2025-10-26 11:22:12,2025-10-26 11:16:29,63-83,,1,40,,Teologia,Wolfhart Pannenberg,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178598,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y_TyfEermGdTXJa-g-YGfzyxhom_PsFY/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to find an answer to this question, the author analyzes 63 texts from the council which contain the word historia or the related adjective (historicus). Beside a massive recurrence of this term – an innovation if compared with all the previous councils – the Vatican II reveals a double interest towards past history and present history as well. Above all, in the perspective set out by the council, the Church itself has a strong historical dimension. As a consequence, there is a rise in concern about ecclesiastical historiography, which at the same time gets more conscious of worldwide and ecumenical issues and more receptive to the various expressions of the life of Christian communities.",2015-03-01,2025-10-26 11:16:29,2025-10-26 11:28:45,2025-10-26 11:16:29,29-62,,1,40,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120178583,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sB0MC8VTL_X8r8KxDaWl7Vn6XX5Pw-vi/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the canonical discipline, in order for a marriage to be valid there is no need for a certain level of faith, but only true consent is required. It is also claimed that the canonical form is needed just for disciplinary reasons while the liturgical form is accounted only as a solemnitas externa of the sacrament. The paper analyzes the causes of such issues, linking them to the modern anthropology of the subject, which has had a deeper influence on the theology of marriage than the biblical anthropology of the foedus. The Author offers some overall rethinking on the matter and comes to two main conclusions. (1) The liturgical form is to be intended as constitutive of the sacrament of marriage, and not just as a ritual ornament of the consent. It is not a supplement to the matrimonial consent, but it is key to shape it. (2) The availability to accept the religious dimension, i.e. “being united by God”, as well as the willingness to be included in the one faith of the Church are the two requirements for a true consent to make the sacramental marriage.",2015-06-01,2025-10-26 11:18:44,2025-10-26 12:34:53,2025-10-26 11:18:44,212-249,,2,40,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120175369,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aWYLGQBsNCJ25xU-PBzwGS2nyvfudsnL/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stake is very challenging: by the renewal of the themes concerning human sexuality, the relationship among men, women and procreation and the sacrament of matrimony, Gaudium et spes is at the same time the arrival point of a long tradition and a starting one to go on thinking. It is nowadays the task of moral theology to take up the council teachings about matrimony and family to gather their instances, to underline their critical knots, to thematize their doubts and to suggest an interpretation of all that could be equal to Christian witness.

A correct Christ-centred definition of theology actually sends back to the mission of the Son who is Jesus in his singular historical authenticity, the same to the mission of the Holy Spirit who is the highest truth of the Grace in us. We understand how the principle and the total object of theology is really the Trinitarian mystery, that is the gift of himself that God performs from the beginning of Creation, predestinating us in Christ to the communion with Him. The original and radical unity of Christ’s predestination is given us in Jesus’ singular story like a historical event, not-deducible and free, which preserves the original correlation of the involved terms (like the human and the divine, the natural and the supernatural, history and truth) without obliged reductions or deductions. Right this functioning of the truth of human beings in Christ and therefore of their relationship to God is preserved by Christ’s unique story.",2015-09-01,2025-10-26 11:19:40,2025-10-26 12:39:06,2025-10-26 11:19:40,389-431,,3,40,,Teologia,La Trinità e la predestinazione in Cristo,,,,,,,ita,,,,120175323,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wq8hl1Z4Zbwvmw_H8AkR57cXmhZo_HK1/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most original and promising particular of the review worked out by Taylor consists of the choice of interpreting such a plot not only starting from the passing of theoretic models but also starting from the changes of socio-cultural and ecclesiastical practice. The ground thesis is that the aforesaid changes do not necessarily state, at all, the end of religious and particularly Christian experience but on the contrary they prepare the conditions for an unsuspected re-pattern of its. Therefore in our present age the concept of secularization may send, from one side, to the reduction of the link to God to a completely optional addition to the practice of a good life; but from the other side it may positively remark the character of a free and responsible reply implied by a believing act, being thoughtfully conscious that it is always practicable to get back to exclusive humanism.",2015-09-01,2025-10-26 11:19:40,2025-10-26 12:37:58,2025-10-26 11:19:40,432-450,,3,40,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120175335,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jFXWSvk95O1tGRXgna8k0oD8qlFetF8e/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Christian spiritual experience brings out any truth seed as any human feature is considered in its quality of reality appealed by God’s self revelation. After rhapsodic expounding the contemporary spiritual background the article concentrates on the analysis of two suggestions of “atheistic spirituality” (A. Comte- Sponville and L. Ferry). Their essential elements, their interests and their incongruity are here pointed out. Above all here is stressed the supposed incompatibility of an authentically human discourse and a religious experience. In the last part of the essay some research tracks are analyzed which are rooted in some key texts of Council Vatican II, where the suggestion is to deepen the link between anthropological basic experience (freedom, desire, affections and fertility) and spiritual experience, rediscovering the anthropological and baptismal pertinence of the form of sequela Christi sine glossa (obedience, poverty, virginity). The finding of these connections lets anyone reconsider the most important spiritual characters from a testimonial point of view.",2015-09-01,2025-10-26 11:19:40,2025-10-26 12:39:24,2025-10-26 11:19:40,451-473,,3,40,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120175360,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ulnU1nkbgfjGdmeK1jSeWNFiFjHmzx_W/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are indeed the core of the author’s ample and appreciated theological dissertation, whose fundamental principles they constitute. Ecumenism, at first seen as a dutiful, unavoidable task of Christian Creeds, minutely and reverentially stated in all the modes of its being put into effect, up to the tragically present one of martyrdom, which enumerate the victims of several religious confessions. At the core of such barbarian cruelty, there stands the contempt for the worth of man’s life and its basic existential meaning. This accounts for the choice of the second theme: the Eastern and Western common tradition concerning the concept of human being, traced back to the basis of an existential ecumenism capable of making unity compatible with the fundamental needs of mankind. The core of such a concept is to be found in the biblical assertion according to which the human being is God’s image in that the Trinitarian God of the Christians exists as a real human being. Trinitarian Theology, in such a way, acquires the highest anthropological meaning and asserts that our personal identity, as is the case for the personal divine identities, achieves its fullness not distancing the others, but in communion with them in and through ‘a’ love that is not confined to the self (1Cor 13.5); on the contrary it is open to sacrifice its very existence to allow the other to exist and to be ‘other’. The more and more urgent task of both Orthodox and Catholic Theologies, which have their roots in the common Patristic inheritance, is the strife to integrate Trinitarian, Christological and Anthropological Theologies thus to ‘serve’ the unity of the Church, not for itself but ‘so that the world may believe’ (John 17,21).",2015-12-01,2025-10-26 11:21:15,2025-10-26 12:42:45,2025-10-26 11:21:15,549-556,,4,40,,Teologia,,,,,,,,ita,,,,120176121,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Glossa,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZKX5ORDRFzDV270RfqCDBG06souyAfOl/preview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his theological work he intends to rediscover the peculiar identity of Orthodoxy before the rest of Christianity today, reinterpreting with authenticity Orthodox Theology, Ecclesiology and Spirituality. He is the representative of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in the various ecumenical meetings and is still the co-chairperson of the joint International Committee in charge of addressing the ecumenical dialogue between the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. The growing interest in his writings on the side of quite a good number of western theologians, the steady increasing number of doctorate essays, then published concerning some themes that have made him known beyond the sphere of his ecclesial membership, witness the high quality of his theological production, his bringing into focus some nuclear components from where to start from, in order to restore the undivided Church, whose realization can only be achieved, not demanding uniformity but giving concreteness to the ontological concept of communion.
